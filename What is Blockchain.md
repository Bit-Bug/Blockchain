Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, 
of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with.
This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.
One solution to this problem is Blockchain, 
which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using Blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.
Blockchain is an emerging technology that can radically improve banking, supply chain, and other transaction networks and can create new opportunities for innovation. Businesses contain many examples of networks of individuals and organizations that collaborate to create value and wealth. These networks work together in markets that exchange assets in the form of goods and services between the participants.
Blockchain technology provides the basis for a dynamic shared ledger that can be applied to save time when recording transactions between parties, remove costs associated with intermediaries, and reduce risks of fraud and tampering.
